Creates a grid with user-given width and height and a single patient zero at the coordinates given. Infection rate, recovery rate, and how many steps of the simulation are all decided by user input. The program runs for the amount of steps given, each step calcuating if a person becomes infected or recovers based on random numbers less than the rate given. A suceptible person can be infected, while recovered patients cannot.

To run the program, simply run the main function and enter enter in the values for grid size, rates, and steps.
